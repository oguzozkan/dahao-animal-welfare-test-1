# Establish @rule_periodic_species_review for Continuous Welfare Improvement

## [THESIS]

**Objective**
Introduce a new rule, `@rule_periodic_species_review`, to mandate the periodic review of existing `@species_profile` entries, especially those with 'UNKNOWN' or 'LOW' sentience confidence, to integrate new scientific evidence and ensure the framework continuously improves its welfare assessments.

**Rationale**
1.  **Implements `@continuous_improvement`:** Scientific understanding of animal sentience and welfare is dynamic. A formal review process ensures the DAHAO framework remains current with the latest scientific discoveries, preventing stagnation in welfare standards.
2.  **Reinforces `@precautionary_principle`:** For species where sentience confidence is 'LOW' or 'UNKNOWN', new evidence could significantly alter their protection status. A periodic review ensures the precautionary principle is actively applied as knowledge grows.
3.  **Enhances `@rule_species_profile_requirements`:** This new rule would complement existing requirements by adding a mechanism for ongoing validation and enrichment of species data.
4.  **Proactive protection:** Instead of waiting for a specific event, this rule establishes a proactive mechanism to identify and update welfare protections based on evolving evidence.

**Proposed Change**
Add a new rule to `data/rules.json` that mandates periodic review of species profiles for updated scientific evidence on sentience and welfare. This rule specifically targets profiles with 'LOW' or 'UNKNOWN' sentience confidence every 12 months, requiring re-evaluation using current scientific literature and proposing updates if new evidence changes confidence level or protection needs.
